      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p class="lead">The internet gave us social media. Crypto gave us ownership. AI gave us intelligence. Savannai merges all three into a living, breathing world.</p>
      <p>We believe the next era of the internet isn't about scrolling feeds or trading tokens in isolation. It's about shared experiences — being somewhere together, watching something unfold in real time, and feeling the weight of a world that exists whether you're there or not.</p>
      <p>Savannai is that world.</p>

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>A virtual savanna where AI-powered animals live their own lives. They eat, drink, rest, wander, flee, and socialize — not because someone scripted it, but because their intelligence drives them. Players don't control the animals. They observe, coexist, and sometimes disrupt.</p>
      <blockquote>We didn't build a game. We built an ecosystem.</blockquote>
      <p>Every element is interactive. Every animal has agency. Every player shares the same sky. The savanna doesn't pause when you leave — the elephants keep walking, the ostriches keep running, the tortoises keep crawling.</p>

      <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-first design</strong> — animals aren't decorations, they're autonomous agents with perception, memory, and decision-making</li>
        <li><strong>Truly shared</strong> — no instances, no lobbies, everyone is in the same world at the same time</li>
        <li><strong>Zero friction</strong> — open a browser, click enter, you're in the savanna. No downloads, no accounts, no wallets required to play</li>
        <li><strong>Web3 native</strong> — the token isn't bolted on, it's the heartbeat of the community that governs what this world becomes</li>
        <li><strong>Built from scratch</strong> — we didn't fork a template. Every line of code, every behavior tree, every UI pixel was crafted by hand</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Principles</h2>
      <p><strong>1. The world comes first.</strong> Every decision we make prioritizes the experience of being in the savanna. If a feature doesn't make the world feel more alive, it doesn't ship.</p>
      <p><strong>2. AI should feel real.</strong> We don't animate animals on rails. We give them drives, fears, and curiosity — and let the behavior emerge. The result is unpredictable, organic, and sometimes hilarious.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Community owns the direction.</strong> Token holders aren't just investors. They vote on new species, new biomes, new mechanics. The savanna evolves through collective decision-making.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Simplicity is sacred.</strong> You can explain Savannai in one sentence: "Walk around a savanna and watch AI animals live their lives." If it takes more than that, we've lost the plot.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Open by default.</strong> Open source, open world, open access. Anyone can join, anyone can watch, anyone can participate.</p>

      <h2>Where This Goes</h2>
      <p>Today it's a savanna with five species and a handful of players. Tomorrow it could be an ocean, a forest, a tundra — each with its own AI ecosystem, its own community, its own token.</p>
      <p>We're not building one game. We're building the infrastructure for AI-driven shared worlds. Savannai is the first proof that it works.</p>
      <blockquote>The savanna doesn't wait for you. But it's always there when you arrive.</blockquote>
